Last summer i worked as a data intern in Adirondack Ecological Center (AEC), managed by State University of New York,  with the Environmental Data Initiative (EDI) funding. AEC has a long time series of ecological data. Mostly, it's a field based biological research projects. My task is to clean, curate and archive the data using R Language and EML Library.
